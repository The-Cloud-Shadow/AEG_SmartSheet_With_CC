IN THIS PROJECT, WE HAVE TO MAKE JUST THIS MVP, NOTHING MORE. KEEP IT SIMPLE AND SWEET. WE HAVE FAILED TO MAKE THIS MVP BEFORE AND IT MESSED UP, WE NEED TO STOP AND TEST AFTER EVERY PHASE. IT MUST WORK

Project Goal
The primary goal is to rapidly develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a collaborative spreadsheet application. Architectural decisions prioritize a focused feature set and speed of delivery, with advanced features planned for post-MVP phases.

Core Features
Cell Editing: Users can directly click and edit cell values.
Column Formulas: Apply formulas to entire columns (e.g., Column B = Column A / 100).
Data Sorting: Sort data by column values (ascending/descending).
Row Archiving: Use a checkbox to select and archive rows, which are then visually marked with a strikethrough.
Read-Only Columns: Designate specific columns as non-editable.
Dropdown Menus: Select from predefined value lists in designated columns.
Bulk Deletion: Select and delete the values of multiple cells at once.
Undo/Redo: Basic undo and redo functionality for recent changes.
Real-time Collaboration: Multiple users can view and edit the same sheet simultaneously, with changes reflected live.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js with TypeScript.
Backend & Real-time: Supabase for database and real-time subscriptions.
Database: PostgreSQL tables for cells, columns, and archived rows.
State Management: React Context with a useReducer hook for centralized, predictable state control.

Project Status
 Phase 1: Front-End Development (Local Prototype) - Complete
 Phase 2: Real-Time Collaboration (Supabase Integration) - Complete

The spreadsheet now supports real-time collaboration with automatic syncing across multiple users.

# Recent Changes
- Integrated Supabase real-time collaboration with automatic syncing of cell updates, archived rows, and column configurations across multiple users
- Set up Supabase database tables with sample data and enabled real-time subscriptions for multi-user collaboration
- Fixed real-time sync delays by improving subscription logic, preventing infinite loops, and enabling proper real-time publications
- Resolved excessive cell syncing feedback loops by implementing selective sync that only updates changed cells instead of all cells
- Added real-time syncing for column configurations including dropdown options, formulas, and read-only status across all users
- Fixed real-time sync for archiving functionality by correcting archived rows state synchronization to sync the updated state instead of old state
- Added comprehensive logging for archiving sync debugging and removed cell/dropdown logging to focus on unarchiving sync issue
- Fixed unarchiving sync race condition by removing isSyncing blocking for user-initiated archiving actions
- Updated spreadsheet styling with modern design, better colors, hover effects, and changed cursor from crosshair to pointer
- Enhanced cell highlighting with more prominent hover and selected states for better visual feedback
- Added arrow key navigation functionality to move between cells using ↑↓←→ keys, with Enter key moving to cell below after editing
- Added Enter key functionality to start editing a selected cell when pressed (without needing to click the cell first)
- Implemented add and delete column functionality with real-time sync across all users
- Improved add column UI by replacing browser prompts with a professional modal dialog featuring form fields for name, type, and dropdown options
- Added column rename functionality with dedicated modal dialog accessible through the column dropdown menu
- Fixed React warnings about conflicting CSS properties and restored sticky header positioning that was broken during column menu implementation
- Fixed column rename sync issue where second and subsequent column renames wouldn't sync to other sessions by allowing user-initiated column actions during real-time sync
- Added loading screen to prevent displaying stale localStorage data while Supabase data is being fetched on app startup
